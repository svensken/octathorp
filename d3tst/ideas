plot rms vs energy much like NYT "The Facebook Offering: How It Compares" complete with tooltips, zoom in on desirable region

pyinotify only for linux, seems too sophsoph
watchdog testable on mac
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog/0.5.4 - overly basic example
    http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2012/05/10/continuous-integration-in-python-using-watchdog/ - good example
    https://code.google.com/p/python-watchdog/source/browse/doc/examples/simple.py?r=b6b4ce34185c06c4e80f7d9487987f504eba247b - meh, decent example
