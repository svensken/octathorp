	* _ALL_ memory errors should be gone.
	* fixed an error that was only prevalent on 32-bit machines.
	* cleaned up the code a little

Since v0.05
DATE: 2007-03-26
	* Some memory bugs were found and squashed.
	* Introduced a new method for scoring the full path; this more
		accurately reflects the CE method.  Alignments should
		improve because of this.

Since v0.03
DATE: 2007-02-01
Found a small bug with calculating scores.  Alignments should, in
general be of lower RMSD and longer.

Since v0.02
DATE: 2007-01-31
Found a small bug in sequencing.  Fixed it.

CEAlign has the semantic, and syntactic formalism of

 cealign MASTER, TARGET

where a post-condition of the algorithm is that the coordinates of the
'''MASTER''' protein are unchanged.  This allows for easier
multi-protein alignments.  For example,

 cealign 1AUE, 1BZ4
 cealign 1AUE, 1B68
 cealign 1AUE, 1A7V
 cealign 1AUE, 1CPR

will superimpose all the TARGETS onto the MASTER.
